=== Getting Started with NFC

NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a protocol for the contactless exchange of data between devices (such as the Android-powered Nexus S) and/or certain kinds of tags. NFC also interoperates with certain RFID tags such as the Mifare tags. Where the fun begins is when you throw hobbyist hardware into the mix. The inexpensive ($30) SonMicro RFID reader/writer, when paired with an equally inexpensive antenna, gives you the ability to encode custom messages on RFID tags that you can later read by tapping the tags against your phone. This book shows how you can exchange data between Android, Arduino, and Processing using NFC and RFID.
