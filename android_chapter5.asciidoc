Professional game development of complex 3D games is difficult and expensive, and it is beyond the reach of the individual developer. But there is also a class of games that a single developer can easily build using only Java/Dalvik and the standard APIs offered by the Android SDK. This book provides the knowledge and example code that will allow a relatively junior Android developer to develop their own games in Java and XML. It will also show you how to make your game available for download on Android Market.
