When the capabilities of HTML5 are combined with CSS3 and Javascript, web application developers have an opportunity to develop compelling mobile applications using familiar tools.

Additionally, through the practical samples in the book you will have been given solid exposure of where both the opportunities and challenges lie when building mobile apps the web way.
